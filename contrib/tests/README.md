# Tests

## Regular expressions

### IPv6 addresses

`ipv6_*` files contain addresses originally sourced
[here](https://static.helpsystems.com/intermapper/third-party/test-ipv6-regex.pl).
Dotted-quad addresses have been moved to `ipv6_*_ipv4` to simplify testing of
expressions that don't allow IPv4 addresses to be embedded.
