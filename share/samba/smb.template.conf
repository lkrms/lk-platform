# The configuration below is intended as a reasonable baseline for Samba on
# standalone desktops, laptops and servers. To that end:
# - Print services are completely disabled
# - Interoperability with Windows, macOS and Linux clients is prioritised over
#   support for Unix file modes and POSIX ACLs
# - Home directories are shared but are not browseable
